            <p>The transatlantic slave trade is often regarded as one of humanities most darkest periods, full of atrocities of a unprecedented scale. In response to this, certain educational leaders & politicians have attempt to minimise thier nations impact, by claiming a nation/empire 'ended' Slavery, or simply refusing it acknowledge its part in the event. </p>
            <p>This data visualisation attempts to show the viewer the logistics of the Transatlantic Voyage to combat the myths and misrepresentation of history which we see in our educational systems.</p>

              <h2>Who 'Ended' Slavery?</h2>
              <p>Some historians' credit the British Empire for ending the slavery trade in 1807 with the abolishment of slavery. This is false. Other than Haiti and Denmark abolishing slavery prior, using this scatter graph, we can see the accelerated trend for larger & and more frequent ships carrying enslaved people to the USA, Brazil & the Caribbean.</p>

            <h2>Who where the biggest players?</h2>
            <p>Often, the British and French are highlighted as key players, but with this timelined pie chart, it can be shown how large a proportion Portugal and Spain played, and how this evolved and changed over centuries.</p>

            <p>Through the timelapsed chart we can see that from 1800's onwards, the role which Portugal and its associated empire played was exponentially increasing across the altantic passage as britain passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade#cite_ref-146">Slavery Trade Act. </a> This change can caused increase in the price of price of slaves, which the portuguese <i>Prazeros</i> took advantage of. <a href="https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1083&context=vocesnovae">Lorenzo, P (2014)</a></p>
            <p>In addition to Portugal, Spain / Uruguay also played a large part in this last stage of the Altantic Trade. With little to no competition, for the last sixteen years of the transatlantic slave trade, Spain was the only transatlantic slave-trading empire.</p>
