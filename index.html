        <h1>Addressing Misconceptions of the Slave Trade</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            A interactive data visualisation of the many voyages from europe to the americas in the transatlantic slave trade. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cotton-capital-ongoing-series">This data visualization was inspired by The Guardians 'Cotton Capital' specifically "Itâ€™s not unpatriotic to tell the whole truth about Britain and the end of slavery"</a>
          </p>
          <p>The transatlantic slave trade is often regarded as one of humanities most darkest periods, full of atrocities of a unprecedented scale. In response to this, some educational leaders & politicians have attempt to minimise thier nations impact,  by claiming they 'ended' Slavery, or simply refusing it acknowledge thier part in the event. This data visualisation attempts to show the viewer the logistics of the Transatlantic Voyage to combat the myths and misrepresentation of history which we see in our educational systems.</p>

            <h2>Did Britain 'End' Slavery?</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, Britain is credited for 'ending the slavery trade in 1807. Other than Haiti and Denmark abolishing slavery prior, using this scatter graph, we can see the accelerated trend for larger & and more frequent ships carried enslaved people to the USA, Brazil & the Caribbean.</p>
