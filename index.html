          <h3>The transatlantic slave trade is rightfully regarded as one of humanities most darkest periods, full of atrocities and wrongdoings. In response to this, educational leaders in some countries have attempt to minimise thier impact, by claiming they ended it, or by simply refusing it acknowledge thier part in the event. This data visualisation attempts to show (and not tell) you, the veiwer, how the logistics of the Transatlantic Voyage can combat the myths and misrepresentation of history which we see in our modern day.</h3>
